In our healing process we use the Twelve Steps, adapted from Alcoholics Anonymous, to address the mental, emotional, and spiritual components of an eating disorder. We learn in ABA that eating disorders are a form of addiction, that the key to recovery is finding sobriety in eating and exercise patterns, and that none of us can do that alone. ABA is a welcoming and caring community and offers support to anyone with a desire to stop unhealthy eating practices.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit www.studenthealth.ucf.edu/crc or www.aba12steps.org.

UCF's performance will be sung in English and accompanied by members of the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra under the direction of Maestro Hanrich Claassen, who himself lived and taught music in Vienna for several years. This performance is of the second act of the opera, set at a ball in the lavish villa of the wealthy Russian Prince Orlofsky. Dr. Falke has arranged the ball as a way of getting revenge on his friend Gabriel von Eisenstein. Many humorous moments of mistaken identity are punctuated by delicious music including the Champagne Chorus and a genuine Viennese waltz finale.\n(The second act of the operetta will also be performed fully staged with the orchestra on Saturday, March 4 at the Plaza Live as a fundraiser for the FSYO. Details about that event can be found at www.fyso.org.)\n",

It also can be one of life's most challenging experiences.We help support those who are caring for a loved one with illness or memory loss.\nResearch shows that when caregivers attend organized support groups run by trained professionals, they can double the amount of time a senior with dementia can stay at home, rather than be cared for through an outside and often more costly program. Support groups also provide increased peace-of-mind to families trying to accommodate their loved one's wishes.\nCaring for the Caregiver sessions will address valuable coping skills needed to deal with conflicting demands, ways to understand and manage challenging behaviors, the importance of self-care and time away, future care considerations, and more. And because caregiving can be isolating, support group members often find great comfort by sharing their experiences with others in similar situations.\nSpring Dates\n\nFebruary 7- 4:30-6:00pm\nSKIP\nFebruary 21- 4:30-6:00pm\nFebruary 28- 4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 7-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 14-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 21 - 4:30-6:00pm\nLocation: UCF Health, East Orlando office. 3400 Quadrangle Blvd. Orlando, FL 32817\nContact Daniel Paulson atDaniel.Paulson2@ucf.eduorsee the Dept. of Psychology OLDeR Lab for more details.\nRSVP is required.

Fiore, Ph.D.ProfessorUCF Department of Philosophy and the Institute for Simulation &amp; Training\n\nThe 21stcentury presents a profound paradox for scientific research. On the one hand, we've been witness to exponential growth in understanding across scholarly disciplines coupled with technological advances allowing for nearly ubiquitous access to data, information, and knowledge.On the other hand, the cognitive and collaborative capacity of humans has not advanced at nearly the same pace.In short, there is a problematic asymmetry between the rapid advances in science and technology and the relatively glacial pace of evolution in human cognition.\nIn this talk, I provide a path forward for addressing this paradox. I outline how the concept of transhumanism, made possible by developments in the cognitive sciences, can be adapted to augment collaborative cognition and help us solve some of the most challenging societal problems in the coming decades. I describe how advances in cognitive engineering and computer science, coupled with technology developments in augmented cognition and brain-computer interface, provide the potential for significant gains in cognition.",

We learn in ABA that eating disorders are a form of addiction, that the key to recovery is finding sobriety in eating and exercise patterns, and that none of us can do that alone. ABA is a welcoming and caring community and offers support to anyone with a desire to stop unhealthy eating practices.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit www.studenthealth.ucf.edu/crc or www.aba12steps.org.

It also can be one of life's most challenging experiences.We help support those who are caring for a loved one with illness or memory loss.\nResearch shows that when caregivers attend organized support groups run by trained professionals, they can double the amount of time a senior with dementia can stay at home, rather than be cared for through an outside and often more costly program. Support groups also provide increased peace-of-mind to families trying to accommodate their loved one's wishes.\nCaring for the Caregiver sessions will address valuable coping skills needed to deal with conflicting demands, ways to understand and manage challenging behaviors, the importance of self-care and time away, future care considerations, and more. And because caregiving can be isolating, support group members often find great comfort by sharing their experiences with others in similar situations.\nSpring Dates\n\nFebruary 7- 4:30-6:00pm\nSKIP\nFebruary 21- 4:30-6:00pm\nFebruary 28- 4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 7-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 14-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 21 - 4:30-6:00pm\nLocation: UCF Health, East Orlando office. 3400 Quadrangle Blvd. Orlando, FL 32817\nContact Daniel Paulson atDaniel.Paulson2@ucf.eduorsee the Dept. of Psychology OLDeR Lab for more details.\nRSVP is required.

        "description": "Abstract:\nBecause time and space play a similar role in wave propagation, wave control can be achieved or by manipulating spatial boundaries or by manipulating time boundaries. Here we emphasize the role of time boundaries manipulation. We show that sudden changes of the medium properties generate instant wave sources that emerge instantaneously from the entire wavefield and can be used to control wavefield and to revisit the holographic principles and the way to create time-reversed waves. Experimental demonstrations of this approach with water waves will be presented and the extension of this concept to acoustic and electromagnetic waves will be discussed. More sophisticated time manipulations can also be studied in order to extend the concept of photonic crystals and wave localization in the time domain.\n\nBiography:\nMathias Fink is a professor of physics at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI ParisTech), Paris, France. In 1990 he founded the Laboratory Ondes et Acoustique at ESPCI that became in 2009 the Langevin Institute. In 2002, he was elected at the French Academy of Engineering, in 2003 at the French Academy of Science and in 2008 at the College de France on the Chair of Technological Innovation. He has received several scientific awards as the CNRS medal of innovation, the Rayleigh Award of the IEEE Ultrasonics Society (2012), the ERC SYNERGY Grant (European Research Council) for the HELMHOLTZ project (2013) and the Edwin H. Land Medal of the Optical Society of America (OSA), 2014\nMathias Fink's area of research is concerned with the propagation of waves in complex media and the development of numerous instruments based on this basic research. His current research interests include time-reversal in physics, wave control in complex media, super-resolution, metamaterials, multiwave imaging, and telecommunications. He has developed different techniques in medical imaging (ultrafast ultrasonic imaging, transient elastography, supersonic shear imaging). He holds more than 70 patents, and he has published more than 400 peer reviewed papers and book chapters. 6 start-up companies with more than 300 employees have been created from his research (Echosens, Sensitive Object, Supersonic Imagine, Time Reversal Communications, CardiaWave and GreenerWave).\n\nFor additional information:\nAristide Dogariu\nadogariu@creol.ucf.edu\n",

He quickly developed a unique style of comedy that highlights articulate and sharp dialogue and is rooted in conversations reflecting the American political landscape. By 1999, he had cultivated a loyal fan base and was performing on some of the most notable comedy stages in the United States. After conquering the stage, Williams made a smooth transition into film and television.\nIn 2002, Williams appeared as a guest star on \"NYPD Blue\" and soon followed up with appearances on many other popular shows before being cast in his first film appearance as Money Mike in \"Friday After Next\". His other film appearances include \"Rebound\" in 2005, \"Epic Movie\" in 2007, and \"First Sunday\" in 2008. Williams' latest film, \"Bastards\", is set to be released in 2017.\nWilliams also appeared on Nick Cannon's popular MTV improv show \"Wild n' Out\" where he performed for three seasons. He was also able to turn many of his own shows into HBO Specials including \"The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1\", \"It's Pimpin' Pimpin\", \"Kattpacalypse\", \"Priceless: Afterlife\", \"Katt Williams Live\", and \"American Hustle\".\nGet Tickets Here",

However, the related IPprotection issues in 3D printers are still largely underexplored. Onthe other hand, smartphones are equipped with rich onboardsensors and have been applied to pervasive mobilesurveillance in many applications. These facts raise onecritical question: is it possible that smartphones access the side-channel signals of 3D printer and then hack the IP information? In this talk, we answer this by performing an end-to-end study onexploring smartphone-based side-channel attacks against 3Dprinters. Specifically, we formulate the problem of the IPside-channel attack in 3D printing. Then, we investigatethe possible acoustic and magnetic side-channel attacks usingthe smartphone built-in sensors. Moreover, weexplore a magnetic-enhanced side-channel attackmodel to accurately deduce the vital directional operationsof 3D printer. Experimental results show that by exploitingthe side-channel signals collected by smartphones, wecan successfully reconstruct the physical prints and theirG-code with Mean Tendency Error of 5.87% on regular designsand 9.67% on complex designs, respectively. Our studydemonstrates this new and practical smartphone-basedside channelattack on compromising IP information during 3Dprinting.",

Although less famous than the 1215 Great Charter of King John, the Charter of the Forest is the reason why the former acquired its name (Magna Carta, reissued in 1217, was called the great or long charter in comparison with the Forest Charter).\nThe Charter of the Forest allowed Englishmen to use certain common lands wrongly claimed by King John and his predecessors. Although the rights granted were narrower than the various procedural rights in Magna Carta, they had relevance for all the king's subjects, not just the barons and great lords. In this lecture, Professor Tate will use these two charters to illustrate the problem of defining fundamental rights, and will explain how the real importance of the original Great Charter has sometimes been misunderstood.\nView event flyer here",

        "description": "This event is FOR CREDIT! Please sign in when you attend!\nKayla Harrison made history at the 2012 Olympics in London by winning the first Gold Medal by any American (man or woman) in the history of the sport of judo. Her victory marks another step in a career characterized by success at the sport's highest levels. Kayla's judo career has been undeniably impressive. However, it is her perseverance through incredible personal struggles that is truly inspiring.\nKayla began judo at the age of 6. As a teenager, she quickly distinguished herself as one of the top junior players in the country. Among other national titles, she won the Junior U.S. Open in 2003, 2004 and 2005. She was a two-time US Senior National Champion before she turned 18 and she became only the third American to win the Junior World Championships in 2008. She won a Silver Medal at the Junior World Championships in 2009 and became Senior World Champion in 2010. She was only the fourth American ever to become World Champion. Since 2008 Kayla has been on a world podium every year.\nHer competitive success masked an unimaginable personal struggle. At the age of 16, Kayla revealed the fact that she had been for years sexually abused by her coach. After the story came to light, Kayla moved from Ohio to Massachusetts to train with Jimmy Pedro, a two-time Olympic Bronze medalist and his father Jim Pedro, Sr. The Pedros became Kayla's coaches but also her surrogate family. When she arrived in Massachusetts, she entertained suicide, was depressed, hated judo and wanted to run away. Through discipline, tenacity, and the support of others she fought through the pain both on and off the mat, transforming herself into a strong, confident, articulate young woman who happens to be a world-class athlete.\nShe also summoned the courage to face her abuser, delivering a victim impact statement at his sentencing hearing in Federal Court in Ohio. She intends to use her Gold Medal profile, voice, and example to encourage and empower others. She also plans to maintain her dominance on the mat by remaining a competitive Judo player with sights on defending her Gold Medal in Rio in 2016.\nHer story has captivated audiences everywhere and has been featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, USA Today, Time Magazine, The Today Show, CNN, MSNBC, among many others. Kayla was awarded the 2012 OC Tanner Inspiration Award, The Women's Sports Foundation's Wilma Rudolph Courage Award; was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year for 2012, Boston GlobeMagazine's Bostonian of the Year, and the Boston Sportswriter's Association Athlete of the Year. She has been inducted into the New York Athletic Club Hall of Fame and the Middletown High School Hall of Fame.\nKayla created the Fearless Foundation to shine a light on the darkness that is child sexual abuse and to enrich the lives of survivors through education and sport, leading survivors to mastery and enabling them to flourish in all aspects of life. She is a member of the Board of Directors of Doc Wayne, an organization that provides sports-based therapy for at-risk youth, and uses her voice on behalf of countless organizations dedicated to protecting children and women.",

        "description": "Serving as a caregiver for a loved one can be a rewarding experience. It also can be one of life's most challenging experiences.We help support those who are caring for a loved one with illness or memory loss.\nResearch shows that when caregivers attend organized support groups run by trained professionals, they can double the amount of time a senior with dementia can stay at home, rather than be cared for through an outside and often more costly program. Support groups also provide increased peace-of-mind to families trying to accommodate their loved one's wishes.\nCaring for the Caregiver sessions will address valuable coping skills needed to deal with conflicting demands, ways to understand and manage challenging behaviors, the importance of self-care and time away, future care considerations, and more. And because caregiving can be isolating, support group members often find great comfort by sharing their experiences with others in similar situations.\nSpring Dates\n\nFebruary 7- 4:30-6:00pm\nSKIP\nFebruary 21- 4:30-6:00pm\nFebruary 28- 4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 7-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 14-4:30-6:00pm\nMarch 21 - 4:30-6:00pm\nLocation: UCF Health, East Orlando office. 3400 Quadrangle Blvd. Orlando, FL 32817\nContact Daniel Paulson atDaniel.Paulson2@ucf.eduorsee the Dept. of Psychology OLDeR Lab for more details.\nRSVP is required.

Dr. Joyce will give an inspiring, accessible, interdisciplinary talk about drones for coral reef mapping on The Great Barrier Reef in Australia.\nThis talk is open to the university community and the general public.\nFor more information, please contact Dr. Timothy Hawthorne at timothy.hawthorne@ucf.edu or 407.823.1030.\n\nThe science and art of using drone technology for coral reef mapping\nWhile drones may at times be demonised by the media with concerns around safety and privacy, their role in environmental survey and monitoring is becoming increasingly important. Aerial and satellite imaging has long been used for survey purposes, but now drones are entering the market to provide cost-effective data capture and flexibility not achieved in the past. They are able to provide highly detailed data at a scale similar to in-situ observations, but at a fraction of the time required for more traditional field survey methods. Recent advances in technology including sensor miniaturisation now also enables drones to be mounted with a variety of different cameras and sensors, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the environment in ways that far surpass what the human eye can detect. This presentation will describe the current status of drone technology data acquisition and processing in the context of environmental earth observations, with a particular focus on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. It will highlight not only the benefits and challenges of working with this type of data but will provide information on a pathway for beginners to become involved through the She Flies programs and resources.\n",

        "description": "Advances in machine learning have led to rapid and widespread deployment of software-based inference and decision making, resulting in various applications such as data analytics, autonomous systems, and security diagnostics. Current machine learning systems, however, assume that training and test data follow the same, or similar, distributions, and do not consider active adversaries manipulating either distribution. Recent work has demonstrated that motivated adversaries can circumvent anomaly detection or classification models at test time through evasion attacks, or can inject well-crafted malicious instances into training data to induce errors in classification through poisoning attacks. In addition, by undermining the integrity of learning systems, the privacy of users' data can also be compromised.\nIn this talk, I will describe my recent research addressing evasion attacks, poisoning attacks, and privacy problems for machine learning systems in adversarial environments. The key approach is to utilize game theoretic analysis and model the interactions between an intelligent adversary and a machine learning system as a Stackelberg game, allowing us to design robust learning strategies which explicitly account for an adversary's optimal response. I'll briefly discuss human subject experiments that support the results of mathematical models, and I will also introduce a real world malware detection system deployed based on adversarial machine learning analysis.",

This talk will review the basic physics governing mean precipitation, as well as present a new theoretical framework for intuitively understanding as well as quickly estimating this quantity.",

Meals on Wheels is a non-profit organization that provides meals to low-income senior citizens. Their mission is tosupport their senior neighbors to extend their independence and health as they age.For millions of Americans, Meals on Wheels is literally the difference between remaining in their own homes and needing to relocate to a nursing facility. The nutritious meal, friendly visit and safety check help them cope with three of the biggest threats of aging: hunger, isolation and loss of independence.\nVolunteer tasks will include decorating paper lunch bags to be distributed to the nearest Meals on Wheels location. This event will be taking place in Psychology RM 105 from 3-6PM. No painting skills necessary! By the end of this service event, students will understand the objectives of Meals on Wheels and learn facts on the aging community in America.\nStudents are welcome to come and go as they please, as long as they participate in at leastone paper bag paintings.If you RSVP, you will have priority over walk-ins. Due to the limited spacing, if you can no longer attend, please cancel your RSVP so other volunteers have the opportunity to attend.\nTo RSVP for this event, please visit https://ucf.collegiatelink.net/organization/vucf/calendar/details/1271789.

This fraud is possible because telephony networks, including landline, cellular, and VoIP, have weak or non-existent abilities to identify and authenticate users.

        "description": "Presented by: Ernst &amp; Young (Representing Florida Retirement System)\nThis tax planning workshop will help you understand the basics of the Federal tax form 1040, help you learn ways to reduce your taxable income, and even exclude some income from tax altogether! You will learn about the more common deductions and credits available to taxpayers, how much to have withheld from your paychecks, and how to avoid IRS penalties. Additionally, we will discuss an action plan that utilizes tax advantaged retirement savings accounts as a means of efficiently saving for your retirement. During the workshop you are encouraged to apply these tax savings opportunities to your own personal situation, and you will see how they apply to life events such as retirement and education planning. Your action plan will help organize the steps you can legally take throughout the year to minimize your exposure to Federal income tax.\nLive Video Webcast: http://ucf.adobeconnect.com/income_tax_planning\n\nUCF employees can register for each session by logging into Employee Self Service (https://my.ucf.edu):\nCOURSE#: RET26, SESSION: 0001",

This ability helped early people to distinguish friend from foe and was instrumental in our ancestors' survival. As adaptive as this response may sometimes be, it also is the foundation of the biases, stereotypes, and prejudices that are present in our conscious and unconscious thinking.Even when we believe that we have eliminated these biases from our thinking, they still lurk in our heads as a sort of hidden residue. We may deliberately strive to behave without prejudice and may be consciously committed to theequal and fair treatment of other people, but studies indicate that we continue to possess preconceived notions and stereotypes. These hidden biases influence our perceptions and actions.This workshops provides examples of how hidden biases may manifest themselves and, through a self-reflective activity, offers participants a way to examine possible stereotypes they may have been exposed to in their lifetimes from four different sources of information \u2013 the people who raised you, school, the media, and friends.\nRegistrationInstructions\n\nFaculty, A&amp;P and USPS: Register online at my.UCF.edu.\nStudents and OPS: Email your name, phone number and PID/employee I.D. number to diverse@ucf.edu.\n\nFor more information, visit https://diversity.ucf.edu/training/this-semester.",

What must we do to participate? How do we know if Al-Anon has anything to offer us? Join us at 6:30pm on Monday nights and stay for the Al-Anon meeting at 7pm!\nThe Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength and hope in order to solve their common problems. We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic. Whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not, Al-Anon offers hope and recovery to all people affected by the alcoholism of a loved one or friend.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit www.shs.ucf.edu/crc or call the Al-Anon Family Groups Helpline at (800) 344-2666.",

With a strategic plan, you will be able to establish your company's direction, make better business decisions and have a source of increased market share and profitability. A strong, effective strategic plan is the culmination of a series of building blocks including a financial plan, a marketing plan, and a business plan. While most planning courses tackle these plans separately, this seminar will present these four complimentary planning events as a series of activities that build on each other to create an effective, long-term strategic plan for your business. At the end of this seminar, you will have the basis upon which to build a strategic plan that enables you to design your company's future and supports its ongoing growth and success.\nRegister:\nNorth Lake:4/13/201710/12/2017\nSouth Lake:4/20/201710/19/2017",

The strategy of using shock tubes provide an ideal device for acquiring ignition delay times and species concentration time-histories, while laser-based diagnostic studies are non-intrusive, provide in-situ measurements (e.g., concentration of individual species including trace species, and temperature), and have fast-time response (micro-second).\nThe second part of the talk will present state-of-the-art experimental tools \u2013 photoionization mass spectrometry using tunable vacuum-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation \u2013 to the combustion of next-generation biofuels that may be efficiently produced from biomass by endophytic fungi.",

What must we do to participate? How do we know if Al-Anon has anything to offer us? Join us at 6:30pm on Monday nights and stay for the Al-Anon meeting at 7pm!\nThe Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength and hope in order to solve their common problems. We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic. Whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not, Al-Anon offers hope and recovery to all people affected by the alcoholism of a loved one or friend.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit www.shs.ucf.edu/crc or call the Al-Anon Family Groups Helpline at (800) 344-2666.",

We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic. Whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not, Al-Anon offers hope and recovery to all people affected by the alcoholism of a loved one or friend.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit www.shs.ucf.edu/crc or call the Al-Anon Family Groups Helpline at (800) 344-2666.",

This lack of awareness can not only affect our stress levels but also our ability to concentrate and manage emotions appropriately. Learning to be mindful keeps you in the present moment and heightens your awareness.
